# Think Tank 

The plan for Think Tank is to bring a different group of people together to work on individual projects or businesses. A Think Tank brings together people with wildly different skillsets to all work on the same problems. 

# Technologies Used

 SCSS
 JavaScript
 React
 Mongoose
 Express
 Node.js

# Game Plan

Build out a functional post/comment system. (Partially Worked)
Use Authentication to give user access. (Partially Worked)
Pretty Up The CSS. (Doesn't Work)

# Future Plans

I want to make this website functional. Creating a dropdown schema for job titles, making the css actually look realistic.
